# [[!! LEGACY !!]] DMMapp - Digitized Medieval Manuscripts app
## This is a legacy version of the DMMapp. The data contained in data.json is no longer maintained, but the framework of the app will still work. ##

The DMMapp is a webapp containing links to digitized manuscripts repositories available worldwide.

## Where can I find the DMMapp?
You can see the DMMapp in action [here](//digitizedmedievalmanuscripts.org/app).

## How does the DMMapp work?
The DMMapp uses the Google Maps API, DataTables, and JQuery. The data is in JSON format.

We receive a new library via the submission form
We check the new repository and find the best and quickest link to the digitized manuscripts.
We add the new repository to the JSON.
The JSON is read and tranformed into the table.
The JSON is read and tranformed into the pins on the map.

## I love the DMMapp idea, I would like to use it for my own project! Can I?
Yes, of course! Everything we do is CC-BY, meaning you can take anything we did (the repository data, any part of the code, or the whole thing) and use it however you please. Just write somewhere that you got this code from us!
You could use it to make an app about incunabula! An INCUapp (sounds horrible in Italian! Beware!)

## OK, lovely! How do I get started?

Replace the data in the data.json!
